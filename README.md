# directory-scraper

This is a personal project of mine to parse my school directory and search it more easily. As the directory comes in a PDF format, it becomes challenging to find students, especially by dorm and class. Thus, I made this project to make searching the directory substantially easier.

## Dependencies

This project requires [Tesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) and [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/).
